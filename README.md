# Modeling the temporal dynamics of the cervicovaginal microbiome identifies targets to promote reproductive health

## Abstract
Cervicovaginal bacterial communities composed of diverse anaerobes with low Lactobacillus abundance are associated with poor reproductive outcomes. Women in sub-Saharan Africa have higher prevalence of high-risk bacterial communities. However, the transition of cervicovaginal communities between high- and low-risk community states over time are not well-described in African populations. We profiled microbiome composition in 316 samples collected at 3-month intervals from 88 healthy South African women and developed a Markov-based model of transition dynamics that accurately predicted microbiome composition within a broader cross-sectional cohort. We find that Lactobacillus iners-dominant, but not L. crispatus-dominant, communities have high probability of transitioning to higher-risk states. Our model predicts that the population prevalence of low-risk microbial communities could most effectively be increased by manipulating transition probabilities between L. iners- and L. crispatus-dominant communities. These findings identify targets for intervention to more effectively reduce microbiome-associated adverse outcomes among women in sub-Saharan Africa.
